# Irreducible — Business Ideas & Validation (Global Context)

## Mission
Evaluate and prioritize product–market fit opportunities that leverage Irreducible’s proof system (Binius64) for high-value markets (e.g., zkML/AI verification, wallet, identity, blockchain verification).

## Proof System Context
- Reference: https://www.irreducible.com/posts/announcing-binius64
- Strengths to emphasize: performance, scalability, developer ergonomics (fill with your own bullets over time).
- Constraints/assumptions: (update as we learn)

## Validation Dimensions (all ideas)
- MVP validation
- Performance requirements
- TAM/SAM/SOM
- Potential cost & unit economics
- Competitive landscape
- Regulatory & trust
- Risks & open questions
- Execution plan & milestones

## Canonical Outputs
- Each idea yields `/Task/<idea>/report.md` using `.claude/templates/pmf_template.md`.

## Merge Rules (for Header/Context Manager)
- Only write to this file from **/commands/update_context** after human review.
- Summarize learnings; link out to detailed reports in `/Task/<idea>/report.md`.
