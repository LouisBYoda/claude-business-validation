# Claude Business Validation Agents

This repository contains a **collaborative agent chain framework** designed to explore and validate business opportunities for **Irreducible** (e.g., ZKML/AI verification, wallet verification, blockchain verification, identity verification).  

The system uses **Claude Code agents** working together in chains, each with a defined role, updating a shared context, and producing structured outputs (MVP validation, TAM, competitor analysis, costs, etc.).

---

## 🔑 How It Works

1. **CEO chooses an idea** (e.g., AI verification).
2. **Header Agent** initializes a chain in `.claude/Task/<idea>/`.
3. Specialized agents run in sequence/parallel:
   - `research_analysis` → collects knowledge
   - `product_specialist` → validates MVP, feasibility
   - `market_researcher` → TAM/SAM/SOM analysis
   - `competitive_analyst` → competitor benchmarks
   - `trend_analyst` → future signals
   - `data_researcher` → adoption/cost modeling
4. Each writes into that idea’s `outputs/` folder.
5. **Knowledge Synthesizer** merges everything into `report.md`.
6. **Meta-agents** (task distributor, context manager, workflow orchestrator) handle orchestration, scaling, error handling, and context updates.

🚀 Running a Business Validation (in Claude Code)

Pick an idea (e.g., AI verification).

Open .claude/Task/ai_verification/context.md → add any seed info (e.g., links, assumptions).

Run Header Agent (.claude/agents/header.md).

Header Agent distributes tasks → agents write to outputs/.

Check outputs/ folder for interim results.

Final consolidated report appears in .claude/Task/ai_verification/report.md.

✅ Benefits

Dynamic Context: .claude/context.md is always updated and shared across all sub-agents.

Repeatable Structure: Each business idea runs in isolation under Task/<idea>.

Scalable Workflows: Meta agents handle orchestration, parallelization, and context passing.

Consistent Output: Templates ensure every idea produces a comparable PMF report.
